# SemanticWeb - OntoLP OMV-R Portal
This repository comprises of two projects to implement a Semantic Web portal called OntoLP (see the production software at http://ontolp.inf.pucrs.br and http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~linatural/)

The first project was developed using Java and a library developed by HP (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.hp.hpl.jena/jena/2.6.4), which provides a framework to create, read, store and manipulate Ontology Web Language (OWL) files used to discribe ontologies. This project works as a backend infrastructure for the presentation layer, which creates a UI tha allow users to upload Ontologies, discribed in OWL file, and then search Ontologies stored into OVM-R.

The application of OMV-R,an extension of the OMV metadata model for describing ontologies. The motivation is to help users searching for ontologies and ontology research related resources for reuse. In our extension we included information about on- tology evaluation and evolution and we also propose more elaborated ways for describing ontology metrics. The extended model was applied to a web portal for Portuguese ontologies, OntoLP. The model was im- plemented and evaluated through questionnaires answered by users, re- searchers and ontology engineers.
